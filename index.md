### CSCI 527 Applied Machine Learning for Games 

Enabling AI agents following natural language instructions is critical for games. Imagine when you are playing [Pokemon](https://www.pokemon.com/us/) games, and your [Pikachu](https://media.izi.travel/4e9d2b2c-83c3-4a84-8675-7cc276270305/fc7197c5-14e1-481e-998d-9e90b0bd2d0f_800x600.jpg) can strike thunder to its opponents when you . That would be so much fun!! Yet, the technology is not there yet. This project aims to bridge the gap between natural language instructions and agents' actions.

### Task
We develop our system on the [ALFRED dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01734) (Action Learning From Realistic Environments and Directives). ALFRED is a benchmark for challenges AI agents to a map between natural language instructions and sequences of agents.
